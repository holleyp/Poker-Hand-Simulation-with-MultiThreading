# Poker-Hand-Simulation-with-MultiThreading
This is my poker hand simulation project but I converted it to java and added multithreading so it runs significantly faster than the python version

This program runs faster than my python version due to a few optimizations, the algorithm I used to determie what a hand is is quicker and being able to add multithreading also really made this project run faster.
